### Background
The United Health Nations has a mission to promote overall well-being, including mental and social. The 3rd sustainable development goal (SD3) aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages.

This dataset that captures self-reported digital device usage alongside mental health indicators provides valuable insights into these connections. It can support predictive modeling, behavioral clustering, and wellness recommendations—tools that are crucial for developing public health strategies aligned with SDG 3’s goal of promoting good health and well-being for all.


### Hypotheses 
* H1: Increased daily screen time (including social media and gaming) is significantly associated with lower mental health status scores [Poor, Fair, Good, or Excellent] and higher stress levels [Low, Medium, or High].
* H0 (null hypothesis): Daily screen time has no significant association with mental health status or stress levels.


### Key Learnings

Screen Time and Mental Health
* Individuals with excellent mental health tend to have lower screen time.
* There are noticeable differences in screen usage patterns between genders.

Sleep and Stress Relationship
* Individuals with low stress levels have more consistent sleep durations.
* Men with high stress levels tend to get significantly less sleep.

Physical Activity and Gaming
* As gaming time increases, physical activity generally decreases.
* Those with excellent mental health engage in more physical activity.
* The balance between gaming and physical activity varies by gender.

Effects of Different Types of Technology Use
* Different forms of technology use (e.g., gaming vs. social media) have varying impacts.
* There is a negative correlation between social media use and gaming time.
* Excessive technology use negatively affects overall health.
* Physical activity is negatively associated with sleep, technology use, social media use, and gaming hours — indicating that as individuals spend more time on these activities, they tend to move away from physical exercise.
  

### Machine Learning Models Used
